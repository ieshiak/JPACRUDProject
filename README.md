# Description

The Chore Chart Application is a web-based tool designed to help users manage and organize their chores effectively. Users can view a list of chores, add new ones, edit existing ones, and delete chores as needed. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for chore management.

# Technologies Used

Java: The backend of the application is developed using Java, providing robust server-side functionality.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot is utilized to create a stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based application for easier development and deployment.
JPA (Java Persistence API): JPA is used for data persistence and mapping Java objects to database tables.
Bootstrap: The application's front end is enhanced with Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, to improve the overall visual presentation.
Thymeleaf: Thymeleaf is employed for server-side rendering of HTML templates in conjunction with Spring Boot.
MySQL: MySQL serves as the relational database management system for storing and retrieving chore data.
HTML/CSS: Standard HTML and CSS are used to structure and style the web pages.

# Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of the Chore Chart Application, several valuable lessons were learned:

Spring Boot Integration: Integrating Spring Boot simplified the development process, providing a powerful and convention-over-configuration approach.
Bootstrap for UI Enhancement: Bootstrap's integration significantly improved the visual appeal of the application, offering pre-styled components and responsive design.
Data Persistence with JPA: Using JPA for data persistence streamlined the interaction with the database, allowing for efficient CRUD operations.
Error Handling: Implementing comprehensive error handling mechanisms helped in identifying and resolving issues promptly.
User Interface Design: The importance of a user-friendly interface was emphasized, leading to an iterative process of refining UI components for better usability.
Collaboration and Communication: Effective communication and collaboration within the development team were crucial for understanding requirements and addressing challenges.
Testing and Debugging: Rigorous testing and debugging practices were implemented to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
